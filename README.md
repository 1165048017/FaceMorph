FaceMorph
=========

Takes two 3D head models and makes them morph into one another. (June 2010)

------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  
Left click and drag - changes viewing angle in ArcBall style
Right click - opens up menu to select the morphing model  
'p' key - pauses the demo  
Space bar - shows/hides control points
ESC key - quits the demo

It's a sample code to show my possible employer. I utilized libraries for matrix math, visualization, and the RBF interpolation algorithm. 
A head will automatically start morphing into a different head model and then come back to its original form.
